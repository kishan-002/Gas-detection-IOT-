What is a Gas Sensor?
They are electronic devices that detect and identify different types of gasses. They are commonly used to detect toxic or explosive gasses and measure gas concentration.

In this project, I have interfaced a Gas Sensor with Arduino that displays the contents of various gases in the atmosphere. The MQ-2 Gas Sensor can detect a list of Gases along with Smoke. 
So incase you are looking out for a smoke detector, you can modify the same  program for smoke detection.
